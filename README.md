# stuff

     This is just stuff. 
     OakHaven is purposely
     having me dress in femme.
     I don't mean just the clothes,
     but a wig and makeup, too.
     That's fine by me cause I'd
     rather be dressed as such.
     I am happy with my lifestyle
     and nothing is going to
     change it.
